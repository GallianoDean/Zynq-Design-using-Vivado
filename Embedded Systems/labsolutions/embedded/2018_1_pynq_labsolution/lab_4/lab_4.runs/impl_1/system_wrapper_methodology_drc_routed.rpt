CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/FCLK_CLK0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/FCLKCLK[0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.060 ns between system_i/switches/U0/ip2bus_wrack_i_D1_reg/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/m00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/WR.aw_channel_0/cmd_translator_0/incr_cmd_0/axaddr_incr_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0).
